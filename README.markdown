# PEEKABO :camera: :crab:

![Peekabo CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/peekabo/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

***A graphical interface to display images. :camera: :crab:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I recently installed Arch Linux on my main machine and I didn't have a program to open images, I thought I'd write one in the best language in the world and the Tauri framework. Enjoy. :heart_on_fire:

## STATUS :warning:

***THIS PROJECT IS STILL HEAVILY W.I.P.***

## INSTALLATION :inbox_tray:

***COMING SOON!***

## USAGE :hammer_and_pick:

***COMING SOON!***

## BUILD FROM SOURCE :hammer:

Make sure you have the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- [Git](https://git-scm.org)

After you have confirmed that both are installed, execute the following steps to build ***Peekabo*** from source:

- 1.) Download the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angeldollface/peekabo
```

- 2.) Change directory into the source directory's root:

```bash
cd peeakbo
```

- 3.) Install Tauri's CLI:

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
```

- 4.) Build the source code into a graphical executable for your platform:

```bash
cargo tauri build
```

- 5.) This should produce a binary bundle in the `target/release/bundle/your_platform` directory where `your_platform` is the name of your operating system. Enjoy. :heart:
